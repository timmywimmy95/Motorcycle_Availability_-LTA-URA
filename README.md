# Motorcycle Parking Availability in Singapore

This project was to help Singaporean motorcyclists find available parking lots in the city state. Many shopping malls & smaller districts (e.g. Town/CBD) do not provide motorcycle parking lots and many times, motorcyclists resort to parking illegally (e.g. roadside, pedestrian pavements) and get fined.

## Find a Carpark 
  - You can either find a carpark near you , or a carpark near a landmark. 
  - Carpark results within a radius of 2km, together with the number of available lots and distance to proximity of location/destination will be shown. 
  - Click on the hyperlink for an address to be directed to Google Maps
